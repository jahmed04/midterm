Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. After creating a JAVA text file, we save it as a .java file in the memory.
Then we compile this text using javac compiler which creates a .classfile.
Classfile contains bytecode and finally JVM reads the bytecodes in memory and turns it into machine readable code.

what is class?
A. A blueprint containing data and methods where objects are created.

What is object?
A. An instance of the class

What is the entry point of an application?
A. Main method

Why main is static?
A. JVM needs the access to execute codes, STATIC keyword let JVM to call main method without objects.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object Class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path - is used to locate .exe files
   ClassPath - is the path for compiled classes

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface - a blueprint of a class
   Abstract Class - to make a calss concrete and implement abstract methods

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. NO
   Interface contains methods which we can implement them in abstract classes

what is Access Specifier?
A. To determine the visibility of methods and variables

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP - Object Oriented Programming
  1. Encapsulation - data hiding
  2.Inheritance - acquiring class properties
  3.Polymorphism - an object can be declared into different classes
  4.Abstraction - hiding the implementation

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. java.lang
 This java package provides the default classes

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API - Application Program Interface
  JDK
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. NO
  JAVA compiler can't determine which method to display from multiple clasees
  if the same method belongs to more than one class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. If a same method has different arguments, then method overloading happens.
 It happens during COMPILE TIME.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception means there's something wrong in the code.
We could debug and look for mistakes or import java.io.IOException or use try catch block or throw exception

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

Final Class - can't be subclasses
Final method - can't be overridden

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. final - constant keyword
finally - we use it to execute try and catch block
finalize - is a garbage collector method

What is a constructor ?
A. A method that initialize objects

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. YES

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. A default constructor

What is JAR stand for ?
A. Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JDK - platform dependent
JVM - platform independent

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JVM - executes all the codes. Both JDK and JRE depends on it
JRE - a tool to only run the program

What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time - when the program is compiled into a .class file
Runtime - when the program executes

What is heap?
A. Memory of ram where we stores all the obects

How java manage it's memory?
A. Stack keeps all the variables and Heap contains all the objects.
Main methods executes on stack.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String - immutable
StringBuffer - mutable and synchronized
StringBuilder - mutable and non-synchronized

What is Singleton class?
A. A class that can have only one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization - converting objects into byte codes
Deserialization - reverse process of getting objects from byte codes

when to use transient variable in java?
A.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.
What is Enum?

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. Serial - this collector uses a single thread
Parallel - this collector does minor collections in parallel

What is JIT stands for?
A. JIT - Just In Time (compiler)

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. Heap space - during run time non-referenced objects need to be removed from heap space memory
and garbage collection collects those objects during collection process
Garbage Collection - an automatic process to manage the runtime memory

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. NO - it's not a guaranteed process

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Heap - bigger memory space, store objects
Stack - smaller memory space compared to heap, store variables

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection allow us to examine the code during run time and it's useful to find errors

what is multithreading in java?
